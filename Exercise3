1️⃣ Create a tuple for a patient
`python

Patient tuple: (Name, Age, Blood Pressure, Heart Rate)
patient = ("John Doe", 45, "120/80", 72)
print("Patient tuple:", patient)
`

---

2️⃣ Access and print the patient’s age and heart rate
`python
print("Age:", patient[1])
print("Heart Rate:", patient[3])
`

---

3️⃣ Why tuples are suitable for storing patient vitals
- Tuples are immutable, meaning the data cannot be accidentally changed.  
- They are ordered collections, so each element (Name, Age, BP, HR) has a fixed position.  
- This makes them ideal for fixed records like patient vitals, where consistency and reliability are important.

---

4️⃣ Convert tuple to list, update heart rate, and convert back
`python
patient_list = list(patient)       # Convert to list
patient_list[3] = 80               # Update heart rate
patient = tuple(patient_list)      # Convert back to tuple
print("Updated patient tuple:", patient)
`

5️⃣ Create a tuple of 5 patients and extract all names
`python
patients = (
    ("John Doe", 45, "120/80", 72),
    ("Jane Smith", 50, "130/85", 78),
    ("Peter Kim", 38, "110/70", 65),
    ("Alice Brown", 60, "140/90", 82),
    ("David Otieno", 55, "125/80", 75)
)

Extract names using list comprehension
names = [p[0] for p in patients]
print("Patient names:", names)
`
