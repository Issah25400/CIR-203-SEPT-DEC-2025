import numpy as np

Example transaction volumes (random integers for illustration)
transactions = np.array([
    [120, 150, 130, 160, 170, 180],  # Branch 1
    [200, 210, 190, 220, 230, 240],  # Branch 2
    [90,  100, 95,  110, 105, 115],  # Branch 3
    [300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350]   # Branch 4
])

print("Transaction Volumes:\n", transactions)
`

---

2️⃣ Total transactions per branch
`python
branch_totals = np.sum(transactions, axis=1)
print("Total transactions per branch:", branch_totals)
`
- axis=1 → sum across columns (months).

---

3️⃣ Identify branch with highest total transactions
`python
highestbranch = np.argmax(branchtotals) + 1  # +1 for human-readable branch index
print("Branch with highest total transactions:", highest_branch)
`
- np.argmax returns the index of the maximum value.

---

4️⃣ Average monthly transaction volume across all branches
`python
average_monthly = np.mean(transactions, axis=0)
print("Average monthly transaction volume:", average_monthly)
`
- axis=0 → mean across rows (branches).

---

5️⃣ Reshape to 3×8 format
`python
reshaped = transactions.reshape(3, 8)
print("Reshaped array (3x8):\n", reshaped)
`

Implications of reshaping:
- Reshaping does not change the data, only how it is organized.
- Original shape: (4, 6) → 24 elements.
- New shape: (3, 8) → still 24 elements, but grouped differently.
- Meaning: Branch/month interpretation is lost; the data is now just a flat sequence reorganized into a new grid.

✅ Marks breakdown:
- Step 1: 4 marks → correct creation of array.  
- Step 2: 4 marks → correct summation per branch.  
- Step 3: 4 marks → identification of max branch.  
- Step 4: 4 marks → average per month.  
- Step 5: 4 marks → reshape + explanation.
